notes: What tools are required to develop your project? Docker? Any other external requirements?
What is in your "scripts" section? What do they do for your developers? Are you using any git hooks?
Do you use some version of gitflow? When a developer opens a PR which branch should they target?
Found some tools but quality is not great
